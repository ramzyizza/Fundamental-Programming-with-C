## Problem 1

Mr. Gama and Mr. Gala were present in class 1 hour before the final exam was held. Because they waited too long, they agreed to try a game.
The game starts with Mr. Gala writing N positive integers on the board.

The rules of the game are as follows:
 1. On a turn, someone must randomly choose two numbers in different positions, for example a and b, then delete both numbers, and write a new number **|a-b|** (absolute value of a-b). 
 2. The game stops when only one number remains. They both played in turns with Pak Gama starting the first turn. If the remaining number is an even number, then Mr. Gala wins. However, if the remaining number is an odd number, then Mr. Gama wins.

## Task
Make a flowchart that starts from reading input N which states the number of numbers, then reading N positive integers, and so on until determining who is the winner of the game.

Flowcharts can be written by hand or using tools, such as draw.io. The symbols used must be standard symbols.
