## Problem 3

Mr. Gama is making a space monitoring system. Mr. Gama uses a number of N temperature sensors in the room. Each sensor will provide data on temperature measurement results and humidity measurement results.
You have been asked by Pak Gama to create a program to determine how many sensors have temperature measurement results above the average and humidity measurement results above the average.

## Input Formats

 - Input consists of several lines. The first line consists of a positive integer N with a maximum value of 1000, which indicates the number of sensors owned.
 - Next, there are N rows, each row containing two real numbers with a maximum value of 100, which indicate temperature (in Celsius) and humidity (in percent).

## Output Format
- Output how many sensors have above average temperature measurement results and above average humidity measurement results.
