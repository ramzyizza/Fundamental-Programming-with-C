## Problem 4
- Cana, Mr. Gama's daughter, is learning division. Now, he really likes studying
divide a number by 3 repeatedly, for example 30 / 3 = 10, 10 / 3 = 3, and so on.
- Until now, he can divide from 10,000. If the result is less than or equal to 1, Gana says he has "done".
- Write a program with a recursive function to make gradual divisions like Cana did.

## Input Formats
- The input consists of an integer N that is more than 1 and less than 10000.

## Output Format
- Output the division and result.
