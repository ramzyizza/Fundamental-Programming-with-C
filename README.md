## Extra Notes
**Assignment:** The course includes weekly assignments that consist of 3-5 C++ programming questions derived from the topics being taught. These assignments are designed to reinforce learning and practice. Every assignment is documented in a detailed report, ensuring it's self-explanatory and easy to understand.

**Final Exam:** A comprehensive final exam is conducted to assess the entirety of the course content. This exam comprises 5 coding questions. Like the assignments, the exam is also carefully documented in a report for clarity and ease of understanding.
